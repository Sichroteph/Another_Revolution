## Revolution watchface

Implemented by Douwe Maan.
Slightly modified by Christophe Jeannette in order to add :
- Slicker animations
- Battery instead of the year
- Two automatic languages : English and French
- BT disconnection vibration

Envisioned as a watchface by Jean-NoÃ«l Mattern (Jnm), who posted it in the ["Watch-face ideas" thread](http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/comment/3538/#Comment_3538) on the Pebble forums.

Based on the display of the [Freebox Revolution](http://www.free.fr/adsl/freebox-revolution.html), which was designed by Philippe Starck.
